This repo contains all of the source code files in jupyter notebook format for my blog on machine learning.

This content is displayed on a MERN stack blog maintained by myself and my partner Gerard Ramos.  [MLHQ.io](https://github.com/gerardramosm89/mscsblog)

### More coming soon...

What is the path to being a machine learning engineer.
```
Basics:
  Metrics, basic - False positive, False negative
      Effect of imbalanced datasets, how to tune for aggressiveness
  What kind of data do I have, what kind of algorithm do I need
      Classification vs Regression
      Time series data (order matters)
      Markovian space, non-markovian
  How do I guess and check effectively
      How do I deal with roadblocks efficiently
```
